                    Businesses especially must help lead the way. At Kami, we are working to do our part by building an ethical supply chain that creates high-quality, low-impact, long-lasting products. We carefully consider our materials and work with our production partners to reduce waste, chemicals, and plastics that endanger our planet’s ecosystems. Our timeless basics are designed to last—so making the right choice by the planet can be as simple as putting on a T-shirt.

                    In order to hit our sustainability goals—and hold ourselves accountable to our customers—we have publicly committed to two broad initiatives: eliminating all virgin plastic from our supply chain and moving all of our cotton production to organic. Large-scale change rarely happens quickly, but we are making swift and promising progress toward our goals.

                                There are more than eight billion tons of plastic on the planet. And once it is made—it never goes away. In 2018, we made our first environmental commitment: eliminate all virgin plastic from our supply chain by 2021, which includes our products, packaging, poly bags, offices, and stores.
                                <br> <br> 
                                <b>Our Progress—</b>The majority of our virgin plastic is concentrated in three areas: fabric used in apparel, components in our footwear and accessories, and polyester bags that cover every product leaving our factories. To date, we have transitioned 75% of our relevant apparel materials to recycled materials made from plastic water bottles, fishing nets, and other items destined for the waste stream—we label these ReNew. We have transitioned 45% of our footwear components to recycled materials. We have switched our virgin plastic shipping bags to renewed versions and recycle them at our distribution center to create furniture.

                                Worldwide, cotton farming uses more toxic pesticides per acre than any other crop. These chemicals are harming our planet—stripping the land of nutrients, contaminating our water, and endangering the people who grow it. That’s why we’re moving all our cotton to certified organic by 2023.
                                <br> <br> 
                                <b>Our Approach—</b>Certified organic is better for the planet. Instead of toxic pesticides, organic farming uses crop rotation, cover crops and organic fertilizers to create rich life-supporting soil. Pesticides have a bad habit of poisoning groundwater, streams, and rivers, which endangers the people and wildlife that rely on those sources. By replacing dangerous chemicals with natural alternatives and old-school agriculture techniques, farmers are spared dangerous levels of exposure.
